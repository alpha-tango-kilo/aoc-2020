# Day Three - Toboggan Trajectory

[**Link**](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/3)

## Part one

I really enjoyed this challenge.
I didn't try and rush it as fast as I could or make it as lean as possible, and the nicety afforded by doing things properly with enums and structs makes a big difference for readability

## Part two

I was so happy when I saw this challenge.
I had made my system of `Vec2D`s anticipating this scenario and actually hitting the nail on the head (unlike the previous two days) felt great and made this solution super quick and clean to write.
I literally didn't have to touch my `lib.rs`

I also love that Rust iterators have a `.product()` method
