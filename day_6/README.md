## Part one

Looked easy, was easy, scared for how futureproof my solution is for part two...

## Part two

As expected, completely different challenge.
My code for each part does not interact at all.
I saw a quick solution for part two that didn't both to prettify data into structs and went for it.
Really happy with my algorithm honestly, not too much memory usage, O(n) complexity on each group, happy days!
