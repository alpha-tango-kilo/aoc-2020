## Part one

I knew I wasn't going to enjoy this challenge.
Off by one errors are awful and little things like knowing whether to take the `high` or `low` final value when doing binary space partioning trip me up and take way to long to debug and solve.

That having been said, I like the code I've written in the end, making proper use of Rust's traits so it'll do all the heavy lifting for me
