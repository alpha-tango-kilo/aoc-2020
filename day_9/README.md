# Day Nine - Encoding Error

## Part one

Not too bad of a problem.
Perhaps could have implemented it more efficiently but honestly I'd rather do the challenges faster since I'm still seriously behind.
Did try and make `Buffer` type agnostic, but trait bounds and I don't get on well so it was just easier to leave it as `u32`s only for sake of the challenge

## Part two

Nice enough, but not a task really compatible with the data structure I had made in part one, so I added the 'logging' I needed to do part two in `main()` because I'm lazy
