## Part one

As much as it's tedious, parsing stupid string formats into something meaningful has never been an issue to me.
I do hate how it looks in Rust code though.
I tried to keep things idiomatic by using the `FromStr` interface

Regex might be a bit bloated for this task but I'm comfy with them
